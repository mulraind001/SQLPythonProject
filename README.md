# SQLPythonProject
This Project is done in PyCharm
In order to use this you must have MySQL installed and set up a table.
 I used MySQL Workbench.
Once you run the project, you can look for the local host by going your desired browser and type in 'http://localhost:5000/'
or click on the URL given in the debug.  

Be sure you have commmented out the Query you do not want to test and uncomment the one you do want to test.
